# Agent Instructions

## Repository

- Upstream: `TTLucian/ha-solar-ac-controller`
- All PRs target upstream `main`
- Component path: `custom_components/solar_ac_controller/` (underscore, not
  `solar-ac-controller`)

## Branching

- Never commit directly to `main`
- Branch prefixes: `fix/` bugfixes, `feat/` features, `analysis/` research, `chore/` tooling and CI, `release/` version prep
- Rebase on latest `upstream/main` before pushing
- Confirm the branch before editing - `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. A `git checkout <branch> -- <paths>` in a compound command can leave you somewhere you did not intend.

## Pull Requests

- Always create PRs as **drafts** first
- One concern per PR - keep scope tight
- Draft -> ready fires `ready_for_review`; CI is configured to run on it

## Toolchain - uv, and the lockfile is the contract

`uv.lock` is the single source of truth. `--locked` matches CI: the committed
lockfile is exactly what gets tested.

```bash
uv sync --locked          # install; there is no "test" group, "dev" is default
uv run ruff check custom_components/solar_ac_controller tests
uv run ruff format --check custom_components/solar_ac_controller tests
uv run mypy custom_components/solar_ac_controller
uv run mypy --namespace-packages --explicit-package-bases tests/
uv run pytest
```

- `uv sync --group test` **fails** here - the group is named `dev`.
- `mypy` reads `pyproject.toml`. There is no `mypy.ini`; the two used to coexist
  and `mypy.ini` silently won, leaving the `pyproject.toml` settings dead.
- Never pass `--follow-imports=skip` to mypy. It reports false
  `untyped-decorator` errors on `@pytest.mark.asyncio` because it cannot see
  pytest's own types. The flags above are the ones that work.
- Do not use **black**. `ruff format` is the configured formatter, and one
  formatter is easier to keep consistent than two.
  - An earlier version of this file claimed black "corrupts
    `except (A, B):` into `except A, B:`, which is a `SyntaxError`". That is
    **wrong** on Python 3.14. `except A, B:` parses as a tuple and produces an
    AST identical to `except (A, B):`; verified, not assumed. It was removed
    from CI before this was written down, and the stated reason never held.

## Testing

- Fix test failures before pushing - no PRs with known failing tests
- CI runs `pytest -q --junitxml=junit.xml` and uploads the report as an artifact
- There is **no coverage gate**. Current coverage is ~31%, mostly because
  `sensor.py`, `select.py`, `switch.py` and `number.py` (the HA entity
  platforms) have no tests. Do not quote a coverage floor that does not exist,
  and do not add `--cov-fail-under`: a gate that fails every run teaches people
  to ignore it. `pytest-cov` is available if coverage needs measuring.

## Workflows

Two guards exist because a bad workflow reference fails *silently*:

- `.github/scripts/validate_workflow_actions.py` - fetches each SHA-pinned
  action's `action.yml` and fails on an unresolvable reference or a `with:` key
  the action does not declare. GitHub **ignores unknown `with:` keys**, so a
  typo there looks like a passing job.
- `.github/workflows/actionlint.yml` - syntax and expression checking, including
  shellcheck rules, via the `rhysd/actionlint` container.

Both have caught real bugs here. When adding a workflow step, check the action's
real input names - do not copy them from `actions/setup-python` onto a different
action.

## Pre-commit (optional)

`.pre-commit-config.yaml` mirrors CI: ruff, ruff-format, mypy and actionlint on
commit, `uv lock --check` when the lockfile or `pyproject.toml` changes, and
pytest on pre-push. Keep the pinned `rev`s equal to the tool versions in
`pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`, and the `files:` scope equal to what CI checks - a
hook that checks less than CI reads as a passing check while checking nothing.

The actionlint hook is `actionlint-docker`, pinned to the same image CI uses. It
needs Docker, and for a reason: plain actionlint silently skips every shellcheck
rule when shellcheck is absent locally, which is how unquoted `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`
redirections reach CI.

The mypy hook needs `--namespace-packages --explicit-package-bases`. Without
them it fails outright with "Source file found twice under different module
names", because it hands mypy individual file paths.

```bash
uv sync --locked && uv run pre-commit install
```

## Line endings - everything is LF

Every tracked file uses LF, enforced by `.gitattributes`:

```
* text=auto eol=lf
```

`text=auto` lets git detect binaries, so images and archives are left alone.
**Do not add exceptions.** A single CRLF file makes line endings depend on the
machine doing the checkout, and flipping one turns a one-line change into a
whole-file diff.

If you inherit a file with CRLF, `git add --renormalize .` fixes it. That is
the correct use of the command - it is only wrong when applied to files that
are already correct, which rewrites them for no reason. Never override
`core.autocrlf` for a single `git add` to force the opposite.

## JSON files - edit, never re-serialize

Do not read a repo JSON file with `json.load` and write it back with `json.dump`.
`manifest.json`, `strings.json` and `translations/en.json` all use hand-set
2-space indentation; a serializer round-trip rewrites every line, producing
an enormous diff for a one-key change.

Edit the specific line with the editor tool or a targeted `sed`. If a bulk edit
is genuinely needed, verify with `git diff --stat` that the change is
proportional - check the stat *before* committing, not after.

## Translations

- `custom_components/solar_ac_controller/translations/en.json` is the only
  translation file in this repository, and it is the source of truth.
- New UI strings go in `strings.json` **and** `translations/en.json`. Both are
  required; a key present in only one shows up untranslated in the UI.
- There is no translation script here. Do not add one by copying it from
  another repository.

## Releases

- A release needs `release_notes/RELEASE_NOTES_vX.Y.Z.md` or the release
  workflow creates nothing and raises a warning in the run summary.
- Prerelease versions (containing `-`) are skipped by the workflow and
  published by hand via the API.
- Bump `manifest.json` by editing the one `version` line, then tag only after the
  release merge lands on `main`.
- The drafter attaches `solar_ac_controller.zip` and updates an existing draft
  rather than skipping it.

## Home Assistant version pinning

`uv.lock` pins Home Assistant to a **pre-release** (`2026.10.0b0`) so CI stays
forward-compatible rather than trailing the stable release. That is a
deliberate, per-repository choice: repositories sharing this tooling lock
different versions, so read `uv.lock` rather than assuming a shared value.

You do not choose the Home Assistant version directly. The test harness pins it
with `==`, and there is one harness release per Home Assistant release:

```
0.13.354 -> 2026.8.0     0.13.363 -> 2026.9.0    0.13.367 -> 2026.9.4
0.13.358 -> 2026.9.0b0   0.13.365 -> 2026.9.2    0.13.368 -> 2026.10.0b0
```

So to move Home Assistant you move the harness, and the newest harness is not
always what you want - `0.13.368` pins a **pre-release**, so taking it would
move CI off stable. To land on a specific stable Home Assistant, pin the harness
that ships it:

```bash
uv lock --upgrade-package 'pytest-homeassistant-custom-component==0.13.367'
```

`requires-python` must stay `>=3.14.2,<3.15`. A looser bound makes uv keep a
second, much older homeassistant entry in the lockfile for 3.14.0/3.14.1
markers, which silently pins CI to a version nobody runs.

Home Assistant pins `uv` itself, so the `uv` entry in `uv.lock` tracks whatever
the pinned Home Assistant requires. The project's own uv is the
`astral-sh/setup-uv` action in the workflows, which Dependabot keeps current.

`.github/dependabot.yml` opens a weekly PR for the `uv` ecosystem, so a newer
stable release arrives as a reviewable diff instead of silently going stale.
The weekly `Dependency freshness` job is the backstop for when such a PR is
not opened.

## Files to never commit

- `*.log`
- `*.txt` used as script output (`requirements.txt` was removed as redundant -
  `uv.lock` supersedes it)
- `config_entry-*.json` (diagnostics dumps)
- `__pycache__/`, `.ruff_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.coverage`
- `pyrightconfig.local.json` - but `pyrightconfig.json` **is** tracked, because
  without an explicit `pythonVersion` Pylance falls back to an older
  interpreter and reports errors that do not exist
- `.envrc`, `.subtask/`, `.claude/`
